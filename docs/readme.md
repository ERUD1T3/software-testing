# Relations review

## One to One relation
binary relation R in which every element y in range of R is related to exactly every element x in the domain of R

## Onto Relation

binary relation R is onto (surjective) if for every element y in the range of R, the exist atleast one element x in domain of R such that R(x) = y
forall y in Y, exists x in X, R(x)=y

eg. every y has at least one antecedent in x

## Reflexive Relation

binary relation is reflexive if it relates every element to itself 
 ∀x ∈ X : x R x

eg. equality

## Symmetric Relation
binary relation is symmetric if 
∀x,y ∈ X : x R y equates to y R x

## Transitive Relation 

binary relation is transitive if 
∀x,y,z ∈ X : x R y and y R z, then x R z

## Function 
relation is a function if every value in the doamin is used and has exactly one value in the range
